Drag & drop your `.gma` or `.vpk` file onto the matching script to extract it.

- `gma_extractor.py`: extract `.gma` addons
- `vpk_extractor.py`: extract Valve `.vpk` archives

Extracted files are written to a folder next to the original archive (same directory, folder named after the archive).

Requires Python 3.
